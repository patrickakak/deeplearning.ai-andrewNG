deeplearning.ai-andrewNG

deeplearning.ai online course, by Andrew Ng, All slide and notebook + data + solutions and video link.  Since some files are huge (ResNet50.h5, yolo.h5, imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat etc.)!  I'm using glf (git large filre storage) to store .h5 files.  Didn't add .jpg and .png in gls mainly for github redering.
